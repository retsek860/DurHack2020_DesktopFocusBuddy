# DurHack2020_DesktopFocusBuddy
A STUDY BUDDY that keeps you focused on your work

Our DurHack 2020 project is a desktop buddy that can help you keep productive, as we all know how easy it is to get distracted. Your desktop buddy keeps a track of what you're up to on your computer and alerts you when you're spending too much time on Facebook or Reddit. Your desktop buddy looks out for you in other ways too! Like when he reminds you to drink water and take a break.
